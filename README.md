# Machine Learning Daily Classes

Welcome to my repository for daily machine learning classes! Here, you'll find materials and code related to my daily learning sessions focused on machine learning using popular libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `opencv`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks with code examples, tutorials, and exercises covered during the classes.
- `datasets/`: Includes datasets used for demonstrations and practice in the notebooks.
- `scripts/`: Additional Python scripts or utilities used in the learning sessions.
- `README.md`: You're currently reading it! This file provides an overview of the repository.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `opencv`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas opencv-python seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

Feel free to explore the notebooks and datasets provided. Each notebook covers different topics ranging from data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Additionally, scripts in the `scripts/` directory may provide useful functions or utilities for your machine learning projects.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional resources related to machine learning, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
